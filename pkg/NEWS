version 0.9.0
- Start tracking changes in R objects, by adding a single line of code to
  an existing script.

- Completely new vignette. Removed dependence on knitr.
- Completely reviewed the reference manual.
- Switched to 'tinytest' testing framework.

- The 'cellwise' logger is now compatible with 'tibble' objects (thanks to
  Blain Bateman). 
- Some documentation improvements.

version 0.2.0
